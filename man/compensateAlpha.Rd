\title{Significance level compensation for multiple comparisons.}

\usage{compensateAlpha(alpha, n, method = c("bonferroni", "sidak"), 
    r = 0)}
\arguments{
  \item{alpha}{significance level to be compensated}
  \item{n}{comparison count}
  \item{method}{compensation method,
'bonferroni' is more conservative, but does not assume
independence of the tests,
'sidak' is more liberal and assumes independence of the tests}
  \item{r}{optional mean "correlation between the tests made",
the extreme value of 0 leads to full compensation, the extreme value
of 1 leads to no compensation (as all the tests are considered equal).
See the SISA help for explanation.}
}

\value{Compensated significance level. It equals 'alpha/n' for the
'bonferroni' method, and '1-(1-alpha)^(1/n))' for the 'sidak
method.}

\title{Plot decorated bivariate correlations.}
\description{\code{\link{plotCor}} creates a matrix of bivariate correlation plots between
all/selected pairs of variables in a data frame, similarly to
\code{plot.data.frame}. On the diagonal, there are histograms of
individual variables colored, by default,according to the estimated
normality of those variables. Below (or above) the diagonal, there
are scatter plots enriched by smoothed conditional estimates of the
mean. Above (or below) the diagonal, there are estimates of the
correlation coefficients and their significances shown.

\code{\link{plotCor}} is based on / inspired by several other similar plots.
I thank their authors, but, unfortunatelly, can't give credits to
them, as I can't remember all of them.

\usage{plotCor(x, method = c("pearson", "spearman", "spearmanExact", 
    "glmPoisson", "lm"), adjust = FALSE, i1 = NULL, i2 = NULL, 
    normalityColor = TRUE, aboveDiag = FALSE, silent = FALSE, 
    plot = TRUE, ...)}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{data frame}
  \item{method}{method
used to compute the coefficient and the significance of the
relation between each pair of variables. 'pearson', 'spearman', and
'spearmanExact' refer to correlation coefficients (the former two
implemented in terms of 'stats::cor.test', the latter in terms of
'coin::spearman_test'). 'lm' refers to a linear model.
'glmPoisson' refers to a Poisson generalized linear model, i.e.
'stats::glm' with the Poisson family.}
  \item{adjust}{adjust p-values to the number of tests performed?
If TRUE, approximate adjustment is used, correcting for the
estimated effective number of tests performed, considering possible
multicollinearity between variables. The effective number of tests
is estimated as 'n ^ (1 - meanCorr)', where 'n' is the number of all
bivariate tests performed and 'meanCor' is the mean absolute value
of correlations between all pairs of variables considered. (For the
purpose of this estimation, Pearson correlation is used when
'method' is set to 'pearson' or 'lm', and Spearman correlation is
used otherwise.)
If FALSE (the default), no adjustment is performed.
If adjust='full' is used, adjustment to the full number of tests
performed is employed.
If 'adjust' is numeric, the number of tests performed is set to this
value.
If adjustment is requested, Bonferroni procedure is employed.}
  \item{i1}{optional vector of indices or names of column of 'x' that
form first elements of correlation pairs. By default, all columns
are considered.}
  \item{i2}{optional vector of indices or names of column of 'x' that
form second elements of correlation pairs. By default, all columns
are considered.}
  \item{normalityColor}{If TRUE, the diagonal histograms of
individual variables get colored according to the estimated
normality of the variables (normality in 'green', non-normality in
'red', indeterminate normality in 'gray').}
  \item{aboveDiag}{If TRUE, scatter plots will appear above the
diagonal and decorations below the diagonal. If FALSE (the default),
scatter plots will appear below the diagonal and decorations above
the diagonal.}
  \item{silent}{if TRUE, the number of tests compenstaing for gets
displayed}
  \item{plot}{if TRUE, a plot is produced.}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments passed on to 'pairs'}

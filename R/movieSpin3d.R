##description<<
## 'movieSpin3d' is basically just a wrapper for
## 'movie3d(spin3d(axis=axis, rpm = rpm), fps = fps, ...)'
## that sets the duration to the value of '60/rpm-1/fps', which
## results in a sequence of frames that form a continuous animation
## when repeated. This is in contrast to setting the duration to the
## value of 60/rpm, which results in rendering the last frame
## identical to the first one, thus making the animation non-smooth.

rpm, ##<< the speed of rotation (rotations per minute)

  if (require(rgl)) {
    # 'rpm' rpm,
    # 'rpm'/60 rotation per second,
    # period of 60/'rpm',
    # 'fps' fps,
    # 'fps'*60/'rpm' frames, but this setting apparently
    # results in one more frame (such that the first and the last frame
    # in a moview are the same), so we need to shorten the duration to
    # 60/'rpm'
    # Example:
    # rpm=5, fps=10,
    # period=60/rpm=60/5=12,
    # frames=fps*period=fps*60/rpm=120,
    # duration=frames/fps=fps*60/rpm/fps=60/rpm=12,
    # updated duration=(fps*60/rpm-1)/fps=60/rpm-1/fps=12-1/10
    #
    # To slow rotation (e.g. half 'rpm') but keep the number of frames
    # constant, we need to half 'fps'. To slow rotation (e.g. half 'rpm')
    # but keep the 'fps' constant, we need to double the number of
    # frames.
